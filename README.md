# Chimp261812
This is my modified version of Chimp261811, it has a cleaner UI and improvements to the cloning process and all round usage.

This Xbox Application is used to clone Xbox hard drives via the Xbox itself.

How to clone your Hard drive using Chimp 261812 from start to finish.

Small update - 05/08/2016:

Added a new option to the Slave drive options.
Fix Error 16, this will clone your working C partition from your master drive.
(it only clones the C partition, all other partitions & partition table if present stay intact)
