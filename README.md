Another small update - 28/11/2016:

Moved to psyko_chewbacca version of GentooxLoader, he had updated the loader and recommended using it as his can also be compiled on modern linux systems.
So its the same edits as before just on a more up to date source.

Small update - 25/11/2016:

Added my modified version of Gentoox loader that auto boot chimp and boot from 6 locations on the E partition.
( note: E partition is mandatory )

	E:\applications\chimp
	E:\applications\chimp loader
	E:\apps\chimp
	E:\apps\chimp loader
	E:\chimp
	E:\chimp loader

Also changed the wording of the Fix error 16 dialogue.


Small update - 05/08/2016:

Added a new option to the Slave drive options.
Fix Error 16, this will clone your working C partition from your master drive.
(it only clones the C partition, all other partitions & partition table if present stay intact)
